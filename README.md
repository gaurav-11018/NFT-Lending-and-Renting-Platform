The NFT Lending and Renting Platform addresses several challenges faced by the NFT ecosystem and its participants. Here's a breakdown of the problems it solves and the 
benefits it provides:

1.Monetization of NFTs: NFT holders can now lend their assets to earn passive income without having to sell them. This allows for better monetization of NFTs and helps 
owners maximize the value of their digital assets.

2.Access to valuable NFTs: Borrowers can temporarily access valuable NFTs for various purposes, such as participating in virtual gaming experiences, digital art 
exhibitions, or other creative projects. This promotes a more inclusive and dynamic NFT ecosystem.

3.Lower barriers to entry: By providing a user-friendly platform that simplifies the lending and borrowing process, more people can easily participate in the NFT market, lowering the barriers to entry for newcomers.

4.Reduced transaction costs: By leveraging the Polygon Mumbai Testnet and the Shardeum network, our platform offers lower gas fees and faster transaction times, making the lending and borrowing process more cost-effective for all users.

5.Cross-chain compatibility: With the deployment of our smart contract on the Polygon Mumbai Testnet and the display of testnet NFTs from the Ethereum network, our platform demonstrates cross-chain compatibility, making it adaptable to various blockchain networks in the future.

Our NFT Lending and Renting Platform makes it easier for NFT holders to monetize their assets, provides borrowers with access to valuable NFTs, and fosters a more inclusive and sustainable NFT ecosystem. By addressing these challenges, the platform enhances the overall user experience and promotes the growth and adoption of NFTs in various industries.
